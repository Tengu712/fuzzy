-- Defining variables test. --

-- `i32` has a `->` function.
-- NOTE: Since Fuzzy doesn't support assignment,
--       variables must be redefined each time to update them.
12 -> 'a.
a !

-- `i32` has a `=>` function.
-- Consequently, you cannot define a variable named 'a'
-- within this scope or any nested scopes below it.
25 -> 'a.
a !!

-- Although unrelated to the purpose of this test,
-- `!` and `!!` functions return the printed value directly.
-- This might be useful for debugging.
47 + a !!
47 + a, !!
